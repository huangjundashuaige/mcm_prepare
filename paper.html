    based on the isolated virus spreading model,we now want to scale it to multiple city,
and the idea is simple,which is to simulate the behavior of real time virus spreading among countrys
of the real world as much as possible.
    so follow the overall idea,we assumpt that the only way to bring virus from country to country 
is through human traffic which is much realistic because there will be shelters stand right on the 
boundary of two countries and it keeps the animal which can brought the virus away.
    as for details,we gather some data about going aboard with the data of gdp and population of
some countries like us china japan korea.then we draw a conclusion that the population
travel aboard has strongly positive relation with this country's gdp and population.
so we build a simulation model which simulate the day-to-day interaction among countries
which to be specific is that we first creat a class called country which has all the functionality
we need to operate the whole simulation.and each individual country has its private variable which
will be population gdp and the land area.and we also take the unit times as one day and use it as one iteration of
single loop.deep in the loop there just be some interaction like travel out and travel in activity
and there will be probability that the going aboard people will include someone which infected by
the virus.
    finally after the interaction,we use the previous isolated model.by providing the updated
data like population and within them how many people infected by the virus as 
the input of differential equation and we will get the next day state of variable so we can update
the countrys state.
